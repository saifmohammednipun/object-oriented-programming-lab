/*Task â€“ 9

(Health application: computing BMI) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI.
Note that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters.

Here is a sample run:
Enter weight in pounds: 95.5
Enter height in inches: 50
BMI is 26.8573
